<div class="section">

<p>Media Explorer is broadly based on a Model-View-Controller
      architecture.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>Model: Media Explorer has a single <span class="emphasis"><em>root model</em></span>
          (an instance of <span class="type">MexAggregateModel</span>). A plugin loaded
          by Media Explorer's plugin manager can push models, each associated
          with a category (via <span class="type">MexModelInfo</span>), into the root
          model. A model pushed by a plugin can be a simple
          <span class="type">MexModel</span> or another <span class="type">MexAggregateModel</span>.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>View: The top-level view element is an <span class="type">MexExplorer</span>
          instance. This is a horizontally-expanding, single-row
          <span class="type">MexResizingHBox</span>, filled with <span class="type">MexColumns</span>;
          a new column is added each time a new model is added to the explorer;
          the column title is set to the model's category. Focus moves
          between columns in response to UI events (e.g. key presses).</p>
<p>The columns are populated via the controller classes
          (see below).</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Controller: A <span class="type">MexContentProxy</span> instance

          model is added to the explorer, a new column is created, and
          an <span class="type">MxWidget</span> generated and added to the column
          for each <span class="type">MexContent</span> item in the model (currently
          hard-coded to a maximum of 10 items per column).</p>
<p>The default behaviour is for each content item to be
          represented by a <span class="type">MexContentBox</span>. This is an
          expanding widget which displays one line of the content item's

<a name="developers-works-content"></a>Content discovery</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Media Explorer enables browsing, discovery and playback of
      media content; to do this, it needs to have media sources available.
      The Grilo framework for media discovery and browsing is used to provide
      those media sources.</p>
<p>Grilo provides a uniform API for accessing content
      and its metadata. Several Grilo plugins exist for adapting media
      for well-known sources (Vimeo, Flickr, YouTube etc.) so they can be
      presented via the Grilo API.</p>
<p>However, due to various licensing issues, these plugins are not
      enabled by default in Media Explorer. The only plugin which
      is enabled is <span class="emphasis"><em>grilo-tracker</em></span>. This uses
      a Tracker service, running in the same environment as
      Media Explorer, to make media indexed by Tracker
      available through the Grilo API.</p>
<p>Tracker itself is a collection of data mining and indexing
      services, typically used for searching the local filesystem. By
      default Tracker comes with several indexing services called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>miners</em></span>. The most widely used miner is the
      filesystem miner, responsible for indexing local files.
      Media Explorer makes use of the <span class="emphasis"><em>UPnP</em></span> miner,
      if available, which additionally indexes <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play" target="_top">UPnP</a>
      servers.</p>
<p>The diagram below gives a high-level overview of the
      components involved:</p>
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="content-discovery.png"></div>
<p>The arrows between the nodes in the diagram represent
      media data from UPnP servers and the local filesystem being
      scanned, indexed and presented by higher-level components.</p>

<p>Media Explorer is designed to function as a netbook application
      or as a UX for a dedicated media centre distribution. This means
      that the UX is entirely usable without a mouse. However, it also
      means that it may be used with input devices other than a keyboard
      (such as a TV remote control). On top of this, the application
      may also run in environments where a full X environment is not
      available (for example, where the application is on a different
      GDL plane from the X server, as might happen when running
      on a processor like
      <a class="ulink" href="http://download.intel.com/design/celect/downloads/ce3100-product-brief.pdf" target="_top">Intel's
      CE3100</a>).</p>
<p>To this end, a small daemon called <span class="emphasis"><em>rebinder</em></span>
      was designed to enable keys from a variety of input devices
      to be mapped consistently to the UX. The technical details of
      how this works are outlined below.</p>

              This means that the issue of handling infra-red controls
              is now reduced to the issue of handling evdev devices.

<a name="idp8675552"></a>The trouble with input device keys</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Because Media Explorer is a media browser and player, it
        may be used in contexts outside the traditional netbook or laptop.
        This in turn means that users may want to control it with
        input devices beyond the standard mouse and keyboard, such as
        TV remote controls, for example:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem"><p>keyboards, even ones with all those fancy "Internet
            keys"</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>remotes that are seen as USB HID devices</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>IR remotes exposed as evdev devices via in-kernel lirc</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>However, given the variety of input devices, a couple of
        issues arise:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Some Media Explorer actions (show more info. about
            some content, select some content etc.) naturally map to a
            a user's experience with modern TVs, DVD players,
            CD players, portable music players etc. In turn, a user
            can map those actions onto typical remote control keys
            (in the above case, onto <span class="guilabel">Info</span> and
            <span class="guilabel">OK</span> respectively).</p>
<p>However, these keys don't always have natural equivalents
            on a standard computer keyboard; but a user with a standard
            keyboard should still be able to control Media Explorer. So
            there needs to be some way to map actions (and their
            keys on a remote control) onto standard keyboard keys.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>While remote controls are familiar to users, they
            bring a different set of issues when applied to a UX in
            a traditional Linux environment. Some of the keys on a TV
            remote, when pressed, produce events with keycodes greater
            than 255; however, these events are ignored by X, the
            window manager likely to be used on Linux. In some
            cases, remote control keys even produce keycodes which don't
            have <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> keysym under X.</p>
<p>In this case, these exotic keycodes need to be mapped
            onto keysyms which X does recognise.</p>

<a name="idp8686640"></a>How rebinder works</h4></div></div></div>
<p>rebinder opens the evdev devices and listens
        directly to the kernel for events. Depending on the keycode
        associated with an event, rebinder has two ways of
        dealing with it:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem"><p>Key events with a keycode &lt; 255 are passed through
            to the standard X mechanism for handling.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>For events with a keycode &gt; 255, a new keysym
            for the event is determined by following one of two
            branches:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem">
<p>If the key has a natural mapping to a standard
                keyboard key (see
                <a class="link" href="developers-works.html#developers-works-events-natural-map">above</a>),
                the keysym associated with that standard key is used.</p>
<p>For a list of these natural mappings, see
                <code class="filename">$SOURCE/applets/rebinder/rebinder-evdev-keymap.c</code>
                in the Media Explorer source.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>If there is no natural mapping for the key,
                a keysym to keycode binding from rebinder's configuration
                file is used instead (see
                <a class="link" href="developers-works.html#developers-works-events-rebinder-configuration" title="rebinder configuration">below</a>).
                </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>Note that the resulting keysym is actually a Clutter
            keysym (though these are orthogonal to X keysyms): for
            example, <code class="constant">CLUTTER_KEY_Up</code>.</p>
<p>Once a new "rebound" keysym has been determined, it is sent
            to the X server via <span class="command"><strong>Xtest</strong></span>.</p>

<p>When working with rebinder, you often also need to debug low-level
        events. The following tools can help with this:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p><b><span class="command"><strong>evtest</strong></span>. </b>This outputs raw events from the evdev drivers,
              which can be useful for working out if userland receives
              events from the kernel.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><b><span class="command"><strong>dmesg</strong></span>. </b>Use this to see if an LIRC remote has been detected
              by the kernel. If it has, there should be new
              <code class="filename">/dev/input/event%d</code> devices and
              some new raw events visible via <span class="command"><strong>evtest</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Note that it's likely that in-kernel LIRC devices aren't
            supported on MeeGo (needs to be verified).</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p><b><span class="command"><strong>xev</strong></span>. </b>This can be used to watch events received by X.</p></li>

<p>Media Explorer plugins are packaged as standard shared-object
      libraries or modules. They are then installed into one of the plugin
      directories for Media Explorer, namely:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
            <code class="filename">$INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/mex/plugins</code>
          </p>
<p>This is the main directory where most plugins are
          installed.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
            <code class="filename">$USER_CONFIG_DIR/mex/plugins</code>
          </p>
<p><code class="filename">$USER_CONFIG_DIR</code> defaults
          to <code class="filename">$HOME/.config</code> on freedesktop.org
          compliant distros (like MeeGo). Could be used for user-specific
          plugins.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
            <code class="filename">$CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY/plugins</code>
          </p>
<p><code class="filename">$CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY</code> is
          the directory from where <span class="command"><strong>mex</strong></span> is
          being run.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Responsibility for finding and loading plugins lies with the
      <span class="type">MexPluginManager</span>, assigned as a member variables of the
      Media Explorer application. Plugin loading works like this:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>mex</strong></span> creates a plugin manager
          (an instance of <span class="type">MexPluginManager</span>).</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The plugin manager looks for <code class="filename">.so</code> and
          <code class="filename">.la</code> files in the <span class="emphasis"><em>plugin
          directories</em></span>. (See above for details of where they
          are.)</p>
<p>For each matching plugin file in those directories, the plugin manager
          does the following:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem"><p>Loads the file via GModule.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Looks for a <code class="function">mex_get_plugin_type</code>
              symbol in the module's symbol table.</p>
<p>If the <code class="function">mex_get_plugin_type</code> symbol
              is found, the plugin manager creates an instance of the plugin
              class and puts a reference to it into its plugin list. It
              also emits a <code class="constant">plugin-loaded</code> signal.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Media Explorer responds to the plugin load (through a handler
          attached to the <code class="constant">plugin-loaded</code> signal)
          according to the type of plugin:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>ModelProvider: The models provided by the plugin are
              added into Media Explorer's root model.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>ToolProvider: The tool is added to the tool area
              of the interface; when the tool is activated, e.g. by a
              key press, the <span class="type">ClutterActor</span> associated with
              the tool is presented. This actor can replace some or all
              of the Media Explorer UI with its own "sub-interface".</p>
<p>For example, the Media Explorer search plugin is
              a ToolProvider: when activated, it presents a "search page", with
              a text entry widget for entering a search string and
              an auto-suggest column. The search page replaces the other
              panels in the user interface.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>ActionProvider: The actions provided by the plugin
              are added to Media Explorer's <span class="type">MexActionManager</span>.</p>
<p>Actions are "things you can do to a piece of content".
              Media Explorer displays the actions for a piece of content
              when you press the information key while that content
              is highlighted. For example, <span class="command"><strong>Watch</strong></span> or
              <span class="command"><strong>Add to queue</strong></span> for a video, and
              <span class="command"><strong>View</strong></span> for a picture.</p>
<p>An ActionProvider plugin can add new actions to
              particular pieces of content. Each action is defined by an
              <span class="type">MexActionInfo</span> object returned by the provider;
              this object specifies the MIME types for which an action is
              applicable, as well as the action itself (an instance
              of <span class="type">MxAction</span>).</p>
